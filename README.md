# Data Analysis and Visualization Projects with PNAD 2022 Database

This repository hosts two data analysis and visualization projects based on the Pesquisa Nacional por Amostra de Domicílio (PNAD) 2022 database. PNAD is a survey conducted by the Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística (IBGE) in a sample of Brazilian households. It investigates various socio-economic characteristics of society, including population, education, employment, income, housing, social security, migration, fertility, marriage, health, nutrition, among others.

Both projects focus on analyzing data related to people with disabilities from the PNAD 2022 database, employing different technologies for visualization and analysis.
